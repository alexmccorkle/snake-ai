# Snake AI

## Following a tutorial to make Snake + Train an AI to play it

### Weekend boredom.

Will be using PyGame to make Snake (A very simple version of it) and will be using PyTorch for the Model.

After this I hope to do the same for other games I know of, but will try to do these without the guides for learning's sake.
