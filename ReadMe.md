Post-Video Additions:

- Added Save/Load functionality
  - AI continues from where you left off. Record and total score is also saved/loaded.

## TODO

- Update model to prevent the spinning bad habit.
- See if I can optimize the model any further to see if it can average a higher score
  - Currently slows down around 35 points or so.
